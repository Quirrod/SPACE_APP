# Data Sources

AgriWater Insight integrates data from various sources to ensure accurate monitoring and forecasting of water availability. These sources include:

### 1. **NASA Satellite Data:**
- **Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP):** Measures soil moisture levels to monitor water availability.
- **Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM):** Tracks precipitation rates, essential for flood risk management and irrigation needs.
- **Landsat and MODIS:** Provides detailed vegetation health and evapotranspiration data.
- **ECOSTRESS:** Monitors plant water stress, offering crucial insights into irrigation requirements.

### 2. **IoT Devices:**
- **Soil Moisture Sensors:** Measure water content in the soil in real-time.
- **Weather Stations:** Track localized climate data such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- **Water Flow Meters:** Monitor water usage and adjust irrigation schedules automatically.

### 3. **Drone Data (Optional):**
- **Multispectral Imaging Drones:** Capture aerial views of fields to assess crop health and identify water stress zones.
