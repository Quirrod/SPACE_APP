The hardware components of AgriWater Insight are essential for collecting accurate field data. These include:

### 1. **IoT Devices:**
   - **Soil Moisture Sensors:** Deployed across the field to measure water content at various depths.
   - **Weather Stations:** Track temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall data to provide microclimate insights.
   - **Flow Meters:** Measure water flow and usage in irrigation systems to help conserve water.

### 2. **Smart Irrigation Controllers:**
   - These are connected to the platform and adjust water flow based on real-time data, ensuring optimal irrigation and minimal water waste.

### 3. **Drones (Optional):**
   - Drones equipped with multispectral cameras can be deployed to monitor crop health and water stress in real time.
