The AgriWater Insight platform is designed to be scalable and adaptable for farms of different sizes and locations. Key points include:

- **Regional Expansion:** Start with drought- or flood-prone areas and scale to other regions globally.
- **More Advanced IoT Integration:** Add new IoT devices to gather additional data points like wind speed, radiation, and nutrient levels.
- **Government and NGO Partnerships:** Collaborate with local governments and agricultural NGOs to provide subsidized access to technology and support broader implementation.
- **Machine Learning Enhancements:** Improve prediction models for droughts, floods, and water stress by incorporating more historical data and training machine learning algorithms.
