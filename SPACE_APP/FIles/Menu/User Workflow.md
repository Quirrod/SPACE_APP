### 1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Farmers register on the platform and input details such as their farm's location, size, and crop type.
   - IoT sensors are deployed in key areas of the farm to track soil moisture and environmental data.

### 2. **Data Collection:**
   - Real-time data is collected from NASA satellites, IoT sensors, and drones (if available). This data is stored and processed on the backend.

### 3. **Data Analysis and Monitoring:**
   - Farmers can view real-time environmental data on the dashboard, including soil moisture, precipitation, and temperature.
   - Color-coded risk zones (drought or flood-prone areas) are displayed on the map for easy monitoring.

### 4. **Actionable Insights and Alerts:**
   - The platform provides irrigation suggestions, predicts water-related risks, and sends notifications when immediate action is required.
   - Alerts for droughts, floods, or optimal irrigation times are sent via SMS, email, or mobile notifications.

### 5. **Automated Water Management:**
   - Based on real-time data, the smart irrigation system can automatically adjust water distribution to optimize usage.
   - Farmers can manually override the system via the dashboard or adjust water schedules remotely.
