1. **Provide real-time insights** on soil moisture, precipitation, and evapotranspiration using NASAâ€™s datasets and IoT sensors.
2. **Predict water-related risks**, such as floods and droughts, based on real-time and historical data.
3. **Automate irrigation systems** based on environmental data to conserve water and improve crop health.
4. **Offer actionable recommendations** and warnings based on data analysis and forecasts.
5. **Enable farmers to view and manage data** on an easy-to-use dashboard, accessible via desktop and mobile devices.
