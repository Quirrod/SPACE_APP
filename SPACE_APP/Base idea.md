   - **ECOSTRESS**: Tracks plant water stress, helping determine when irrigation is needed.
   
- **IoT Devices and Sensors:**
   - **Soil Moisture Sensors**: Deployed in the fields to measure water content in the soil at different depths.
   - **Weather Stations**: Track temperature, humidity, and local precipitation to provide microclimate data.
   - **Flow Meters**: Measure water usage in real time to optimize water delivery systems.
   
- **Drones (Optional)**:
   - **Multispectral Imaging Drones**: Capture aerial imagery to identify crop health and water stress zones.

#### 2. **Core Features**:

1. **Data Dashboard**:
   - **Real-time Monitoring**: Display real-time soil moisture levels, precipitation, and temperature on a **map-based interface**.
   - **Historical Trends**: Farmers can view historical data on soil moisture, water usage, rainfall, and crop health for data-driven decision-making.
   - **Visual Indicators**: Use color-coded maps to indicate critical levels of water availability (e.g., drought or flood risk areas).

2. **Predictive Alerts**:
   - **Drought & Flood Forecasting**: Analyze historical and real-time data to forecast droughts or floods. The system sends alerts to farmers, prompting early action.
   - **Irrigation Suggestions**: Based on NASA’s evapotranspiration data and soil moisture readings from IoT sensors, the tool suggests optimal irrigation times and water quantities to conserve resources.

3. **Automated Irrigation Control**:
   - Integrate **smart irrigation systems** that automatically adjust water flow based on data from soil moisture sensors and predictive analysis from satellite data.
   - Farmers can manually override the system through the dashboard.

4. **Remote Sensing Integration**:
   - **Drone Integration**: Drones can be deployed to capture images of fields, showing **crop health** in real time. This data will be analyzed and compared with NASA satellite data to identify any discrepancies between field observations and satellite data.

5. **Customizable Reports**:
   - Generate **custom reports** for farmers based on their farm's location, crop type, and specific needs, including water use patterns, historical data, and upcoming risks.

6. **Community Support and Expert Access**:
   - **Q&A Forums**: Farmers can ask questions and get advice from agricultural experts who can provide insights based on NASA data and ground data.
   - **Training Modules**: Interactive learning modules to help farmers understand how to interpret and act on data.

   - **NASA APIs** for fetching satellite data (e.g., MODIS, SMAP, GPM).
   - **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for storing farm-specific data, historical trends, and sensor data.

- **Hardware**:
   - **IoT Sensors (LoRaWAN or Wi-Fi based)** for measuring soil moisture and environmental parameters.
   - **Weather stations** to capture localized data on climate conditions.
   - **Smart irrigation controllers** (compatible with IoT) to automate irrigation systems.
   - **Drones (optional)** for field monitoring and crop health analysis.

- **Machine Learning**:
   - **Python** with libraries like **Scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow** to build predictive models for droughts, floods, and water stress forecasts.
   - Use historical data and real-time data to train models that predict environmental risks and suggest optimal water management practices.

### **User Workflow**:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Farmers register and input farm details (location, crop type, field size) into the system.
   - Deploy IoT sensors in key areas of the farm to track soil moisture, temperature, and water flow.
   
2. **Data Collection**:
   - The platform collects data from both **NASA’s Earth Observation Satellites** and **IoT sensors** in real time.
   - Drones (if available) capture aerial imagery for on-demand field assessments.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Farmers view real-time environmental data on the dashboard, including soil moisture levels, precipitation, and vegetation health.
   - The dashboard provides an overview of field conditions, highlighting any areas at risk.

4. **Actionable Insights**:
   - The tool provides recommendations for **irrigation** and warns of potential risks (e.g., upcoming droughts or floods).
   - Farmers receive alerts if immediate action is required.

5. **Automation**:
   - Based on the sensor data and recommendations, the **smart irrigation system** can automatically adjust water delivery.
   - Farmers can manually intervene through the dashboard or receive notifications via mobile devices.
